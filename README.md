# Demo

The script `demo.js` shows how to add a customer Prism highlighter to `notebookjs` instance so that the
resulting HTML will have colorized text. This is in contrast to the normal usage where the coloring takes place
in a browser via a Javascript hook.

```
% npm install
% cp nodebookjs.js node_modules/notebookjs/
% node demo.js
% open sample.html
```
